          Dayon Aeta was founded with the goal of supporting and uplifting the Aeta community, one of the indigenous
          groups in the Philippines. Inspired by their resilience and rich culture, the organization was created to
          provide opportunities in education, health, and livelihood.<br /><br />The name "Dayon" means "Welcome" —
          symbolizing an open invitation for everyone to extend help, share kindness, and walk alongside the Aeta people
          toward a brighter future.

      <p class="the-aetas-are-among">
        The Aetas are among the earliest indigenous peoples of the Philippines, known for their deep bond with nature
        and resilience in the mountainous regions of Luzon, particularly in provinces like Zambales, Tarlac, Pampanga,
        Bataan, and Quezon. For generations, they have lived through farming, hunting, and fishing—using the land's
        natural resources for food, medicine, and tools. Their rich knowledge of herbal healing and forest ecology
        remains respected even by non-indigenous communities.<br /><br />Traditionally nomadic, Aeta groups moved based
        on resource availability. However, modern challenges such as land development and deforestation have forced many
        to settle in lowland areas. Despite this, they continue to practice age-old customs like cañao (thanksgiving
        rituals), tayaw (spiritual dances), and duwaling (traditional songs), keeping their cultural identity alive.

    <p class="aeta-society-is">
      Aeta society is built on equality and cooperation. Decisions are made collectively, guided by elders who are
      valued for their wisdom rather than wealth. Property is shared rather than individually owned, emphasizing
      community over personal gain.<br /><br />Today, more Aetas are engaging in education and livelihood programs
      while advocating for land rights and cultural recognition. The younger generation strives to balance tradition
      with modern life.<br /><br />Their story is one of strength, humility, and unity—a powerful reminder of how to
      live sustainably and stay connected to one's roots.

            – Music is central to Aeta gatherings, serving as entertainment, storytelling, and spiritual expression. They
            use bamboo instruments like the kulibaw, balingbing, pattanggok, and tongatong, creating sounds inspired by
            nature. Traditional dances such as tayaw and talipi are performed during rituals and celebrations, often with
            chants or improvised lyrics. These performances preserve history, strengthen community ties, and honor their
            ancestors.<br /><br />
          </span>
          <span class="text-wrapper-5">Livelihood</span>
          <span class="text-wrapper-6">
            – The Aeta lifestyle is rooted in self-sufficiency and harmony with the environment. They cultivate root crops
            like sweet potato, cassava, and taro through shifting farming methods (kaingin), allowing the land to
            regenerate naturally. Hunting and gathering remain vital, with men hunting wild animals and women collecting
            fruits, honey, and medicinal plants. Some Aetas now earn income through handicrafts and selling forest
            products. Despite modern changes, many continue to practice their traditional ways with pride and
            resilience.

            their traditions ensures that their wisdom, values, and unique way of life are passed on to future generations.
            By supporting the Aeta, we protect both their community and the diverse cultural fabric of the
            nation. <br></br>When we protect Aeta traditions, we are not just preserving history — we are ensuring that their children grow up
            proud of who they are, with their language, music, and rituals still alive and celebrated. Supporting the Aeta
            also strengthens the diverse cultural fabric of the nation, reminding us that true progress is achieved when no
            community is left behind. Cultural preservation is not charity — it is a shared responsibility and a commitment
            to honor the roots of our identity as Filipinos.
